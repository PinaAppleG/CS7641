One java class is provided in the Assignment4.java file.  The code has dependencies on the Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning (BURLAP) library: http://burlap.cs.brown.edu.  A number of static attributes are defined to adjust the various parameters of the problem formulations.  The three algorithms may be commented out in the main function for experimentation.  The resulting policies and iteration data are output to file in the outputPath directory.
