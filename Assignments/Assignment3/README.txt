One python script is provided for the analysis: Clustering.py.  In addition, there are four data files: testFeatures.csv, testLabels.csv, trainFeatures.csv and trainLabels.csv.  One test image is also provided for visualization purposes. The CSV test data represents data from the full image set.

The python code has dependencies on SciKit-Learn, NumPy, PIL, and this pull request: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3204 for the multi-layered perceptron.  See also here: http://issamlaradji.blogspot.com/2014/06/week-3-gsoc-2014-extending-neural.html

The various analysis methods may be un-commented to execute them.
